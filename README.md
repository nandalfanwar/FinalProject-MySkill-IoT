ChickWise is an innovative IoT-based solution designed to optimize the environmental conditions within poultry farms. By monitoring and controlling key parameters such as temperature, humidity, and ammonia levels, this system aims to create a safe and healthy environment for chickens, thereby reducing the incidence of diseases like SNOT (Sinusitis or Mycoplasma gallisepticum). This project serves as a testament to the integration of technology with traditional farming practices to enhance efficiency and sustainability. This project is also made to fulfill the requirements for our Independent Study (SIB) completion, led by The Ministry of Education, Culture, Research, and Technology of the Republic of Indonesia through the Kampus Merdeka policy and MySkill.

### Background

Poultry farming faces significant challenges in maintaining the health and productivity of chickens. Environmental factors play a crucial role in the well-being of poultry, with improper conditions leading to stress, illness, and decreased productivity. Specifically, the presence of high ammonia levels and unsuitable temperature and humidity can lead to respiratory issues and diseases such as SNOT.

### Objectives

The primary objective of the Smart Poultry System is to provide poultry farmers with an easy-to-use platform for maintaining optimal living conditions for their chickens. By leveraging IoT technology, this system offers real-time monitoring and remote control capabilities, ensuring that the environment within poultry houses can be continuously adjusted to meet the ideal conditions for chicken health and productivity.

### Key Features

- **Real-Time Monitoring:** The system continuously monitors temperature, humidity, and ammonia levels using a network of sensors.
- **Remote Control:** Farmers can remotely adjust environmental settings through a smartphone application, providing convenience and flexibility.
- **Alerts and Notifications:** The system sends alerts when conditions deviate from preset safe thresholds, enabling prompt corrective action.
- **Data Logging:** Environmental data is logged and stored for analysis, helping farmers make informed decisions based on historical trends.

### Significance

Implementing the Smart Poultry System can significantly enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of poultry farming operations. By ensuring optimal environmental conditions, farmers can reduce the risk of disease outbreaks, improve chicken welfare, and ultimately increase productivity and profitability. This project not only leverages modern technology to solve traditional farming challenges but also promotes sustainable and humane farming practices.
